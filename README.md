## Projects main idea:

"At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently."

*Note: Every project in this portfolio is based on the scenario described above, which is an imaginary one created for educational purposes to complete the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification. Additionally, the same dataset is used for each project.*
