Gained a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of data science, its history, and how it has evolved to become a critical tool for solving complex business problems. Learned about the impact of data today, how it is utilized in various industries, and the growing demand for data professionals.
Explored the key skills and tools that data professionals use to manage, analyze, and interpret data, as well as how data-driven insights can be used to help organizations make informed decisions. I studied the PACE project workflow (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) and its importance in organizing data projects.

**2.Get Started With Python**
In this course, I gained a solid foundation in Python programming and its application in data analysis. I learned how to write Python scripts and programs to solve data analysis tasks and became familiar with Python's syntax, data structures, and control flow.

I also worked extensively with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding, which allowed me to run code and visualize results seamlessly. Through hands-on practice, I gained experience in using variables and data types to store, organize, and manipulate data. I learned essential coding skills, including the use of functions and conditional statements to write clean and reusable code.

Additionally, I explored loops for automating repetitive tasks and worked with string manipulation techniques such as slicing, indexing, and formatting. I investigated core Python data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and arrays, understanding how to use them effectively for data organization and management.

Furthermore, I gained practical experience with popular Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, which are essential for performing data manipulation and analysis. To demonstrate my skills, I completed a final project in which I applied my Python knowledge to solve a business problem using real datasets, drawing meaningful insights from the data.

**3.Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**
In this course, I developed proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA), learning techniques to identify and understand key patterns, trends, and insights within datasets. I gained hands-on experience in cleaning raw data by removing inconsistencies, errors, and outliers, a crucial step for ensuring accurate analysis.

I studied the process of data validation and data joining, ensuring that datasets were complete and accurate for analysis. I also learned how to use Python for performing EDA tasks, including discovering patterns, sculpting data, and preparing it for deeper analysis.

A significant part of the course involved creating data visualizations to present key insights clearly and compellingly. I used tools like Tableau, as well as Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to visualize data and communicate my findings effectively.

Additionally, I focused on ethical and professional data storytelling, ensuring that insights were presented in a way that was both accessible and understandable for stakeholders.

**4.Power of Statistics**
In this course, I acquired foundational knowledge in statistics, learning to distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistics. I developed the ability to summarize datasets using descriptive statistics, measuring central tendency, spread, and the relative position of data.

I gained expertise in probability theory, including Bayes' theorem, and explored various probability distributions, such as binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions. I also studied sampling methods to draw valid conclusions from sample data, minimizing sampling bias, and using sampling distributions to make accurate estimates.

Additionally, I learned how to calculate and interpret confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty in estimates. I also studied hypothesis testing, including t-tests and Chi-squared tests, to assess statistical significance and determine whether results were due to chance.

To apply these statistical techniques, I completed a final project where I analyzed a workplace dataset using the methods learned throughout the course.

## Projects main idea:

"At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently."

*Note: Every project in this portfolio is based on the scenario described above, which is an imaginary one created for educational purposes to complete the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification. Additionally, the same dataset is used for each project.*
