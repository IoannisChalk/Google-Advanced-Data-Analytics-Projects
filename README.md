## Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification Projects Summary

To fulfill the requirements of the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification program, I completed a series of courses and corresponding projects. These projects demonstrate my practical proficiency in various aspects of data analytics.

### Courses Completed:
1. Foundations of Data Science
2. Get started with Python: Basics of Python programming for data analysis.
3. Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights: Advanced techniques for deriving insights from data.
4. The power of statistics: Statistical methods for analysis and interpretation.
5. Regression Analysis: Applied regression analysis techniques to model and analyze complex data relationships.
6. Machine Learning Fundamentals: Introduction to machine learning algorithms using XGBoost and Random Forest with Cross Validation.

## Projects main idea:

"At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently."

*Note: Every project in this portfolio is based on the scenario described above, which is an imaginary one created for educational purposes to complete the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification. Additionally, the same dataset is used for each project.*
